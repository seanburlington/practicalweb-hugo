This site doesn't include any analytics or tracking code, it is a static site hosted on Google Firebase which provides only basic metrics - not IP address based logging.

I don't set any cookies.

The only place cookies are set is where I have embedded Github Gists in which case Github do set an "essential" session cookie not used for tracking.

You can read more about Githubs [Cookie](https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/) [policy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#our-use-of-cookies-and-tracking)
