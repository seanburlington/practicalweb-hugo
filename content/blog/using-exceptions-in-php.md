The Drupal project I've been working on for the last year involved some fairly heavy file processing, with lot's of validation.

To simplify the code I made extensive use of Exceptions, I didn't create that many different Exception classes - but I made sure that any errors which affect the flow of the logic were handled by Exceptions.

This succeeded in making the code much more legible.

And now several months later I'm updating documentation - and it's just great to be able to spot all the error handling code so easily.

It'sÂ  a shame Drupal doesn't use exception handling more in the core.
