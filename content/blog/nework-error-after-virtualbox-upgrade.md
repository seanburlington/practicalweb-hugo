I decided to upgradeÂ  VirtualBox because the newer versions have much better support for networks that allow virtual computer to be visible on the real network.

But after upgrade I encountered the error

> HostInterface': The attribute 'name' is required but missing.

It seems others have had similar issues

I resolved this by deleting this entry:

`<HostInterface/>`

from the config file, in my case this was

`.VirtualBox/Machines/WinXP/WinXP.xml`

After this the virtual machine worked fine - and the new network settings are great.
