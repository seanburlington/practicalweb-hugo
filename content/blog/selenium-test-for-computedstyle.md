I wanted to write some automated tests for CSS changes and bugs, these type of issues are quite prone to regression so re-running the tests has a large benefit.

It is possible to add new assertions to selenium via the user-extensions.js file

The following adds a test for computed style, this only works in firefox as far as I know - but some automation is better than none

```javascript
//only works in firefox
Selenium.prototype.assertStyle = function (locator, text) {
  var params = text.split("=", 2);

  var propertyName = params[0];
  var expectedValue = params[1];

  var element = this.page().findElement(locator);
  var actualValue = this.browserbot
    .getCurrentWindow()
    .getComputedStyle(element, null)
    .getPropertyValue(propertyName);
  Assert.matches(expectedValue, actualValue);
};
```

Now I can add a selenium test like

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>assertStyle</td>
    <td>//td[@class='lender'][1]</td>
    <td>text-align=center</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

Selenium only lets me pass two parameters and really I want three (locator, css property, expected value). So I've hacked this and put two parameters into one - which is a bit smelly but for now gets the job done - comments on better methods very welcome.

I need to at least check that the 'text' parameter is validated properly - but I figured I'd blog now and update later as I've a deadline to meet today.
