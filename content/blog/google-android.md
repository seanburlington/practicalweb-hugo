I have just got the new gphone, the G1 which is a collaborative venture: google provide the OS, HTC make the hardware, T-Mobile provide the netwwork, and loads of software is written by many people - and made available via Google marketplace.

While a few things feel a little beta still; on the whole it all hangs together very well indeed.

First of all it's worth saying the actual phone works very well, something all too easily overlooked.

The rest of the gadgets work great - well enogh for me to write this on the bus.
