I've been looking into git for a while, the core toolset has been mature for ages but it just didn't seem to have the wider support I wanted.

Now I look again and the egit plugin for eclipse has improved massively with full eclipse integration http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide

There is a git plugin for trac http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/GitPlugin

It looks like it's time for me to dive into git properly :-)
