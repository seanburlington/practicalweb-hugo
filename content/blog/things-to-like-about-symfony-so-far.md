A few days into learning Symfony and so far I'm keen on

- configuration check to start with
- good MVC separation
- ability to generate initial MVC components from a database definition
- form validation to match database constraints
- wrapping various HTTP functions and globals in a request and response object
- separate dev and prod environments
- ajax integration - like defining a div as draggable in PHP
- explicit support for initial and test data

Things not to like

- well there are quite a lot of files
