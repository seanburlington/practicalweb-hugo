I’ve just been working on a site that uses [sIFR](http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr/What+is+sIFR)
to incorporate a specific font into the design - this works very well generally but we had a problem where links did not work on the MAC or in IE6.

This problem seems to have been solved in sIFR3 which also brings much more flexibility - styles can change within the replaced text, filters like drop shadow area available - and actions like mouseover can trigger javascript callbacks.

The only thing I couldn’t see a way of doing was changing the background colour of a link on hover…
