I wasn't 100% clear from the docs how to implement rollup rules in selenium ui-elements and searching the web didn't return much - so here's an example in case it's helpful to others.

Add this to the user-extensions.js file

```javascript
var manager = new RollupManager();

manager.addRollupRule({
  name: "compare_product",
  description: "gets to the reults on a compare product page",
  args: [
    {
      name: "term",
      description: "the aliased term name of the category",
    },
    {
      name: "provider",
      description: "the provider name",
    },
    {
      name: "product",
      description: "the product name",
    },
  ],
  commandMatchers: [
    {
      command: "click.+",
      target: "starRatingsCompareProduct::search_go\\(.+",
    },
  ],
  getExpandedCommands: function (args) {
    var commands = [];

    commands.push({
      command: "open",
      target: "/star-ratings/find-star-ratings/" + args.term,
    });

    commands.push({
      command: "selectAndWait",
      target: "edit-provider",
      value: args.provider,
    });

    commands.push({
      command: "pause",
      target: "1000",
    });
    commands.push({
      command: "selectAndWait",
      target: "edit-product",
      value: args.product,
    });
    commands.push({
      command: "waitForElementPresent",
      target: "star-ratings-badge",
    });
    commands.push({
      command: "clickAndWait",
      target: "edit-same-rating",
    });
    commands.push({
      command: "waitForTextPresent",
      target: "Products with the same Star Rating",
    });
    return commands;
  },
});
```

Then you can use it in selenium as below

```html
<tr>
  <td>rollup</td>
  <td>compare_product</td>
  <td>
    term=buy-let-insurance, provider=Cactus Cover, product=Residential Let
  </td>
</tr>
```

This avoids me repeating chunks of code that I would otherwise need to get the page to the point at which I want to test it.

NB I've kind of ignored the commandmatcher bit for the time being (this is a nicety to help the IDE notice a rollup while recording - it's a required field - but doesn't have to be useful).
