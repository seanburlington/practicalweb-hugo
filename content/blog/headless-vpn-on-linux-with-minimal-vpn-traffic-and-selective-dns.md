I needed to setup a VPN client connection on a headless system where the VPN is slow and so I want to route the minimal amount of traffic through it. I need DNS to use the VPN but only for one domain.

This is my setup using pptp and dnsmasq (tested on centOS)



Basic VPN config is here 

`/etc/ppp/peers/office`


```
# written by pptpsetup
pty "pptp vpn.example.com --nolaunchpppd"
lock
noauth
nobsdcomp
nodeflate
refuse-eap
usepeerdns
defaultroute
name sean.burlington
remotename office
ipparam office
require-mppe-128
```


Startup script adds a default route for the network I need to access via vpn and adds the DNS server to dnsmasq config

`/etc/ppp/ip-up.local`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for net in 192.168.128.0/17 ; do
  /sbin/route -v add -net $net dev $IFNAME
  logger -t pppd "added route for $net"
done


cp -f /etc/dnsmasq.orig /etc/dnsmasq.conf

echo "server=/example.com/${DNS1}" >> /etc/dnsmasq.conf

service dnsmasq restart
```

When disconnecting VPN reset dnsmasq, in my case I need the public DNS for example.com when not on VPN

`/etc/ppp/ip-down.local`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

cp -f /etc/dnsmasq.orig /etc/dnsmasq.conf

service dnsmasq restart
```


My `/etc/resolv.conf` points first to localhost where dnsmaq runs, then to my router which provides the upstream DNS

```
nameserver 127.0.0.1
nameserver 192.168.0.1
```
