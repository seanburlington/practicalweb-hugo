I need to use a VPN which was suffering packet fragmentation due to the overhead involved (actually I use a VPN to connect to a network which then has another VPN connection to a third network).

To determine the largest MTU size which didn't lead to fragmentation I just ran variations on

```bash 
ping -M do -s 1327 server.example.com
```

`-M do` prohibits fragmentation so the ping will fail if the packet size is too large

I tried larger/ smaller values till I found the largest number that worked.

Network Manager didn't give me a GUI to set MTU on the VPN connection (it does for ethernet)

So I needed a script in /etc/network/if-up.d/

I called mine like myvpn-mtu (owned by root and executable)

```bash
#! /bin/sh
# set low MTU for my VPN otherwise I get packet fragmentation
set -e


if [ "$CONNECTION_ID" = myvpn ] && [ "$MODE" = start ]; then
  /sbin/ifconfig $IFACE mtu 1327
fi


exit 0
```
Substitute "myvpn" here for your connection name 

The script env has the following variables (I've anonymised some variables)
