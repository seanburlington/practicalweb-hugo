Three are definitely putting a transparent proxy between me and the network.

I just got this error message

Which isn't coming from my web browser (which has a different error page for this problem).

And it isn't coming from the remote server as the message is that it couldn't connect!

This is most definitely filtering.

I've written a small script that outputs text after a couple of minutes. Over a normal ADSL connection it works fine.

But over three's network I get the following results

(using telnet to ensure there is no other program in the way)

```bash
telnet www.practicalweb.co.uk 80
