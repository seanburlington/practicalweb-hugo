This is a now-archived website by Sean Burlington from [2007](/blog/2007/11/12/raid-protecting-my-data/) when I setup a Ltd Company believing I could make a business developing websites through to [2015](/blog/2015/10/09/ubuntu-mysql-root-password-reset-init-file-not-found/) when I stopped blogging for a while after being too busy.

The Company was a success, I think I learned a lot from blogging.
