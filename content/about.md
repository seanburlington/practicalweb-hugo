This is a now-archived website by Sean Burlington from [2007](/blog/2007/11/12/raid-protecting-my-data/) through to [2015](/blog/2015/10/09/ubuntu-mysql-root-password-reset-init-file-not-found/) from when I first setup as a contractor

The company I started became redundant when my last contract became a permanent role but the writing are still of some interest to me and there are some links out there which would be broken if I took it down.

However be warning that this content is all old.

These days (as of 2021) you can find me at
